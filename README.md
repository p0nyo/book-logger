# book-store

Welcome to the book store repository :) 

This project is a simple book management application which serves as my personal introduction to building with the MERN technology stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

Features:
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete book records.
- Data Management: Utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose for efficient data storage and interaction.
- Interactive UI: Developed with React.js for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- Backend Server: Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and server-side logic.
